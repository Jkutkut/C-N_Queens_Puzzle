# N Queens puzzle:

This repository contains logic to calculate and visualice the N Queens problem. It features the use of recursive backtracking to find the solutions and a customizable visualization style.

## Use:

To use the code, you can type on the root of the repository:

    make fclean
    make

Why? To compile the code, there's a Makefile to automate the installation. For a basic install, use:

    make fclean

to clean the binaries and repository, followed by

    make
or

    make all
or

    make XXXXX

To install the alternative style where **XXXXX** is the desired style. See [how to create a custom style](#Create-custom-styles) to create your own.

Once compiled, you can execute the program using:
    
    ./representation X
where **X** is the size of the desired grid (If none given, the default is 8)

## Create custom styles:
Imagine you want to create a style called YYYY. Here are the steps:
- Go to ./src/style/
- Copy any of the already defined styles and renamed it following the same syntax (**YYYY**_chess_style.h)

        cp classic_chess_style.h YYYYY_chess_style.h
- Edit and save the file to your linking.
- Go to the Makefile in the root directory of the repo and add the following line (there's a comment on the spot for you to use :D):

        YYYY: YYYY_chess_style.h $(EXE_NAME)
- That's it! Just recompile using the new style!
